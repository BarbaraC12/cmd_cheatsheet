## 3Ô∏è‚É£ ISSUES

- Use GitHub Issues to track and manage tasks, bugs, and enhancements.
- Click **Issues** tab in your GitHub repository to view and create issues.
- Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce for bugs.
- Use labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, task) to categorize issues.
- Assign issues to team members responsible for resolution.
- Mention issues in commit messages using keywords like `closes #issue_number`.
- Keep discussions on issues constructive and focused on problem-solving.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ ADDITIONAL PRACTICES

- **Configuration Git:** Configure Git settings, especially if your team uses specific configurations or aliases for frequently used commands.
- **Git Ignore:** Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude specific files or directories from version control.
- **Branches to Avoid:** Follow team conventions regarding branch usage, especially branches to avoid (e.g., direct commits on `master`).
- **Conflict Resolution:** Learn effective conflict resolution strategies during merges to handle conflicts efficiently.
- **Custom Scripts and Tools:** Utilize custom scripts or tools that your team may have developed to streamline the Git workflow.
- **Best Practices:** Follow Git best practices, such as avoiding overly large commits and writing meaningful commit messages.
- **Useful Links:** Keep a section with useful links to online resources, tutorials, and reference documents.

These additional practices are meant to enhance your Git/GitHub workflow based on specific needs. Customize the document further based on your team's environment and development requirements.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ UNDO MISTAKES

If you made a mistake, don't panic:

- **Undo the local merge:**
  If the merge hasn't been pushed to the remote repository yet, you can undo the local merge using the `git reset --hard HEAD` command to go back to the state before the merge, discarding local changes.
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD
  ```

- **Check for uncommitted changes:**
  If you've already committed the merge changes, you can view the recent commits using `git log`. Note the commit hash of the commit you want to revert.
  ```bash
  git log
  ```

- **Revert to a previous commit:**
  Use the `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` command to revert to the state of the repository at a specific commit, discarding all subsequent commits, including the unintentional deletions.
  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit_hash>
  ```

- **Force push to update the remote repository (if necessary):**
  If you've already pushed these changes to the remote repository, you'll need to force push after locally undoing the changes.
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch_name> --force
  ```
  Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of your branch.

  Note: Using `--force` to push can lead to loss of history on the remote repository, so use it with caution. Inform others working on the same branch to avoid complications.
